OpenGL Box for Lazarus version 0.1
----------------------------------

By Kostas "Bad Sector" Michalopoulos. Get the latest version at:

Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open the openglbox.lpk package and press "Compile". Then press "Install".
Lazarus will rebuild itself and once finished, the new component will be
available from the "Additional" tab.


Usage:
~~~~~~

Just place it in a form. Note that padding is currently buggy, so if you want
to put it in a panel with raised or lowered borders, you should put a panel in
it without borders and then put the opengl box in that panel with alClient
alignment.

Before doing anything else, fill the RedBits, GreenBits, BlueBits and DepthBits
properties. They should be 8, 8, 8, 24 in most cases. If you want 16bit color
just use 5, 6, 5 or 5, 5, 5 for RedBits, Greenbits and BlueBits (note:
DepthBits is for the "depth buffer" not "color depth").

When you render the scene using standard GL calls, use gl.SwapBuffers

Check the included example for more info.
